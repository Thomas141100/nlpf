A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

-   [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
-   [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Generate routes

We used the package [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route).
You can generate new routes by using this command:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```
